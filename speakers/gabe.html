	These days, we're spoiled for choice when it comes to HTML5 game frameworks.  But with so many frameworks out there, it's easy to feel like you might be picking the wrong one for your next project.  Each framework has their own way of doing things, and it can feel like a big commitment to spend time learning a framework before you know everything it's capable of and if you like its API enough to stick with it.
</p>
<p>	
	I've tried out a few of the popular HTML5 frameworks over the last few years, and <a href="http://phaser.io/">Phaser</a> is my current favorite.  It's got everything you're likely to need (sprites, tilemaps, sound, animation, canvas/webgl, etc), a very active community (20 releases in the last 10 months), and an extensive suite of examples (over 160 playable demos).

<p>	
	A 20 minute conference talk isn't enough time to show off everything, but my hope is to give you a tour of Phaser's features that you're most likely to care about if you're interested in making games with JS.  I want to leave you with enough familiarity that you'll feel comfortable starting your first game, and excited by the possibilities.
