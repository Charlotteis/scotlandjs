        <h1>Memory Leak Health Check - Our Quest to Diagnose & Cure</h1>
      </header>

      <p>
  Browser memory leaks are a little understood problem that affect almost all web developers at some point in their careers. JavaScript has taken centre stage in recent years by enabling us to create ever more complex front-ends and integrate numerous frameworks to maximise results. Better management of memory will lead to performance improvements, enhanced capacity for running on limited resources and increased working lifecycle without crashes.
</p>
<p>
  The session will give an overview to memory management in the browser and introduce common tools and techniques for identifying and investigating web application memory leaks. With practical examples, we will look at browser-based tools, such as, Memory Timeline and Heap Snapshots to equip you with the knowledge to find the problems in your own applications.
</p>
<p>
  Following this, we will take a deeper dive into specific areas we recommend you look at when developing JavaScript applications. You will be shown how to isolate, fix and test the main components of your apps.
</p>
<p>
  You'll leave this session better equipped to find and resolve leaks in your own JavaScript apps!
