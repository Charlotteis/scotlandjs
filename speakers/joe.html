I've worked on some very sensitive front-end codebases (finance, pharma, oil and gas, defence et al) and as a consequence I've come across virtually every type of bad practice (as well as lots and lots of good!). In this talk I'll share some of those experiences and talk about the part security plays in delivering high quality client-side JavaScript, including:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Why you don't control your run-time environment and why that's your biggest problem
	</li>	
	<li>	
		Some inherent problems with JavaScript's security model and design
	</li>	
	<li>			
		Writing secure API's with that in mind
	</li>	
	<li>	
		Exposing and implementing countermeasures for common attacks in highly sensitive codebases
	</li>	
	<li>	
		Patterns and anti-patterns in front-end penetration testing and auditing
	</li>	
	<li>	
		Why security is so important to high quality code, and why you're probably not thinking about it enough
	</li>	
</ul>

Hopefully, by the end of the talk, you'll be able to take away some the lessons I've learnt from the best of these highly secure front-end codebases, and maybe how you can stop yours failing quite as spectacularly as some of the worst ones have.
