	"Callback hell" is an oft-bemoaned state of Javascript programs. Some developers have seen their code trapped in its Ninth Circle and have lost all hope of getting it out. Others are callback agnostics and don't believe this so-called hell even exists. And most of us are probably somewhere in between: working in that pyramid-shaped purgatory where, we think, if we do our Good Parts penitence, we will eventually get our code to the heaven of Readability and Maintainability.

	While smart practices and async helpers can limit the pain of callback-based control flow, ES6 generators make possible new approaches that result in code which is much easier to read, maintain, and reason about. Monocle-js is one such project. In this talk, we'll look at some of the control flow situations which are particularly ugly in callback-based approaches, then discuss ES6's new generator support and `yield` keyword. With a basic understanding of generators in hand, we'll explore how Monocle-js can drag the aforementioned examples out of callback purgatory and set them on the straight and narrow path to Readability and Maintainability.
