At least one in four people will experience a mental health problem in the course of a year. The unwillingness to talk about mental health often makes it difficult for individuals to seek help and obtain the support they need. 

In this talk, Amanda focuses on the importance of talking about mental health - a subject somewhat  different from most of the other conference talks, yet one relevant to many. 

Amanda also speaks openly about her own lived experience of mental health problems â€“ a story of hope and triumph, which provides her with a unique insight into mental health. 

This talk will look not just at mental illness, but at mental wellness and some steps which everyone can take to help keep themselves mentally well.
