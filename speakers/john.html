<p>
	We'll take a gentle look at what functional programming is.
</p>	
<p>
	You'll see how your code can be shorter, more reusable, and easier to test. How problems can be described by the "what" rather that the "how". And hopefully learn how to begin "thinking functionally" to attack problems from new angles.
</p>	
<p>
	All of this from within the comfort of JavaScript, a language well suited to functional programming, and without having to retreat to a cabin in the woods with a stack of academic papers.
