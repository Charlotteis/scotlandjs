	Too few people test their JavaScript, and examples of good tests are too rare. I've spent years publishing testing tools and encouraging people to test JavaScript with as much rigor as they would in any other language. Yet, a handful of tools and a 101-level tutorial of the requisite testing libraries has proven insufficient: many struggle to write tests for the sorts of situations they primarily use JavaScript for (DOM interactions, AJAX, and other asynchronous behavior). I've overcome that in my own practice, and I'd like to do a better job helping others.

	In this session, I'll start each topic by explaining what I don't do, and why the straightforward approaches to JavaScript testing are rife with pitfalls and frustration. It's only fair that I'd pivot to demonstrating how I write tests that clearly specify common needs like events handling, sending XHRs, and DOM manipulation. By working through examples, I'll illustrate how the pain we encounter in our tests can encourage us to improve the design of our code.
