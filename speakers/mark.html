	Web-based audio and video currently take the form of closed boxes, that sit awkwardly on the Internet. It takes a lot of time to find and expose content, and it takes a lot of energy to work with it. This doesn't fit into our vision of the open, remix-able web.
</p>
<p>	
	Hyperaud.io aims to be a complete ecosystem for remixing media, with a twist - media is transcribed and time-aligned right down to the word. Not only does this format allow for highly accurate, accessible and navigable "hypertranscripts", it helps us to create powerful new tools, such as the Hyperaudio Pad, which allows people to remix media using the spoken word as a base.
</p>
<p>	
	We're creating an eco-system that provides a path for people to transcribe and remix their's and other's audio and video content.
</p>
<p>	
	We're creating hyperaudio.js to allow developers to incorporate Hyperaudio into their applications.
</p>
<p>	
	We're creating "view-source" for media and encouraging a new generation to learn and express themselves in new audio-visual ways.
</p>
<p>	
	In this session I talk about why I believe in Hyperaudio - the tools, techniques and tricks we used and the trials and tribulations of creating the suite of Hyperaud.io services and libraries that just made beta.
