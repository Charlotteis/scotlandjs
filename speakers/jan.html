	Ever since I saw Stuart Memo talk about the Web Audio API at JSConf.eu I was inspired to work with the API and see what was possible when Audio and Web collide. This resulted in a lot of experiments and demos in the last year. 
</p>
<p>	
	In the end I convinced my professor to let me experiment even more with it in my master's thesis, although he's never heard of that API. So the last months I spent working on a (minimal) web-based collaborative audio editor, similar to Apple's Garageband. 
</p>

	In this talk I want to share my experiences, introduce you to the API, the editor and the synchronization algorithm and...if all goes well...record some music on stage ;)
