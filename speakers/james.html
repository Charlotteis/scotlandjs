Since Node.js came along, we've seen an explosion of build tools to support JavaScript developers. Jake, Cake, Grunt, Gulp, Fez, I've even invented one or two myself.\r\n\r\nEvery language ecosystem seems doomed to reinvent Make, and many often miss what makes it great. Make has been around for decades and has evolved all sorts of features to express complex file operations quickly. It even knows when files don't need rebuilding, saving you time by skipping unnecessary work.\r\n\r\nIn just a few lines of code, you can specify all sorts of common JavaScript build tasks that take hundreds of lines of plugin code and config in other frameworks. \r\n\r\nIn this talk, we'll learn the basics of Unix's forgotten build tool and see how to set it up to deal with all our common JavaScript tasks with ease.
