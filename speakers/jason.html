	Programming languages have long been shackled to their ASTs, or abstract syntax trees; the formal representation of a program's structure. But what more can we get out of the AST? What if we flipped the notion on its head, and thought of an AST not as the primary driver of program execution, but as a model like any other we operate on when writing more conventional programs? What if we did away with the AST entirely - what consequences would this have for the learnability of programming?

Drawing on the work of Bret Victor, we will explore the possibilities for making programming easier to learn and reason about using a simple visual environment and a subset of Javascript.
