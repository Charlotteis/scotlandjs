	Native platforms hold something over the web: we do not have a meaningful way to ensure that, no matter what the connection of the user is like, we can always deliver an experience.
</p>
<p>	
	ServiceWorker aims to fix this, allowing developers to take control of all resource requests from their pages before they go to the network, and save assets and content in a durable cache.
</p>
<p>	
	We'll go through the state of the offline web today, look at the ServiceWorker proposal, discuss UX and technical implications and touch on the polyfill that enables experimentation today.
</p>
<p>	
	Solving the offline problem moves us a huge leap towards the web being a truly viable application platform.
