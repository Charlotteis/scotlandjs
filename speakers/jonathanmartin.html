<p>	
	Even with WebSockets, Server Sent Events, and WebRTC at our disposal, we continue to treat realtime interactions as a selective enhancement we can hack on to a subset of features after product launch.
</p>
<p>	
	Our antiquated MVP design assumption has been to forgo realtime interactivity. As web apps become the next generation of desktop apps, this assumption is no longer acceptable: we need to take a realtime-from-the-onset approach. However, this mindset brings with it new architectural challenges that remain largely unaddressed.

- What type(s) of software components should be realtime?
- Could the realtime paradigm be reduced to a simple protocol?
- Can we keep authorization code DRY while presenting both HTTP and WebSocket based APIs?
- How can we stick with a fat client, but expose an extensive querying API without compromising on DRY or security?
</p>
<p>	
	Weâ€™ll examine these problems from the client and server-side, consider potential solutions, then code a solution in JS for a concrete app.
</p>
<p>	
	We've got the tools. We just need to stop monkey patching together one-off solutions.
