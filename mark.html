As a lover of all things audio, passion often drives my work and I'm currently enjoying the challenge of taking audio 'somewhere new' with my Hyperaudio (http://hyperaud.io) experiments.

      <h3>Talk</h3>
    <p>
      As a lover of all things audio, passion often drives his work and he's currently enjoying the challenge of taking audio 'somewhere new' with my Hyperaudio (http://hyperaud.io) experiments.
</p>
  <p>

    In this talk Mark focusses on what we can do with audio now that it's all grown up and takes a look at what is just around the corner. He'll talk about his work with large media companies as diverse as Al Jazeera and the BBC and his newly formed experimental non-profit. Among other technologies we'll touch on the new Web Audio API standard, WebRTC, live-streaming and mobile audio.</p>
