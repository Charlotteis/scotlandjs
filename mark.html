      <h3>Bio</h3>
      <p>
I write about, promote and teach new and open web technologies. Co-founder of Happyworm - a small web agency and makers of the popular jPlayer (http://jPlayer.org) media framework (made in Edinburgh incidentally).
  <p>
  </p>

I enjoy pushing the limits of the browser using HTML5 and JavaScript. Though a generalist at heart, I spend much of my time playing with web based media and real-time communications and am actively involved in helping news organisations world-wide as part of the Knight-Mozilla OpenNews initiative, specifically Al Jazeera.
  <p>
  </p>

As a lover of all things audio, passion often drives my work and I'm currently enjoying the challenge of taking audio 'somewhere new' with my Hyperaudio (http://hyperaud.io) experiments.

      <h3>Talk</h3>
    <p>
Flash is dead, long live the web. It's been a long time coming but finally audio is breaking out of its black box and is becoming a first-class citizen of the web. Part of the team that brought you the popular audio/video library [jPlayer] (http://jPlayer.org) Mark has seen the birth of the audio tag and watched it grow up.
</p>
  <p>

    In this talk Mark focusses on what we can do with audio now that it's all grown up and takes a look at what is just around the corner. He'll talk about his work with large media companies as diverse as Al Jazeera and the BBC and his newly formed experimental non-profit. Among other technologies we'll touch on the new Web Audio API standard, WebRTC, live-streaming and mobile audio.</p>
