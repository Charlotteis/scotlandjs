      <h3>Talk</h3>
    <p>
UI testing has been around for years, but never been part of a hype, never made it into the daily workflow of most frontend devs, never has been seen as one of these things that makes our lives easier. Why is this essential tool in our chain treated like a misbehaving stepson?


</p>
  <p>
In this talk we will answer that question, looking back to when it all started to go wrong, examine the current state and looking into the future and how we can bring the power of UI and e2e testing back to the people who build the frontend of the web.
