      Here at ScotlandJS we have one criteria for your talk submission(s); that you submit talks on subjects that you are passionate about. Simple as that.
    </p>
    <p>
      We would love presentations that are 20 minutes long and of interest to JavaScript developers.

      This year we are trying something new with the conference format to encourage more discussion in the community. To achieve this, after each talk a discussion will start in Track 2 based on the subject of that talk. It would be amazing if speakers were available in this session to help explain, clarify and drive a discussion to forward the state-of-the-art, however this is optional.
