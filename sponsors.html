    <header><h1>Platinum Sponsor: 1PartCarbon</h1></header>
    <p>
      1PartCarbon invents stuff, codes stuff, makes stuff and designs stuff.  
    </p>
    <p>
      We are based at Edinburgh's TechCube, where we have grown rapidly in the last 2 years.  We have been profitable since we started and are entirely funded through growth.  We prototype and develop systems, applications/products for customers and ourselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      We invest cash and expertise in other start-ups when we like their projects.  Most of our work is software based but we also build hardware as well as non-digital products. We try and choose projects that are interesting, profitable and challenging and we are continuously developing as a company. As a team we embrace and build upon open source technologies. We have a wide and varied skillset, Ruby, Rails, Ember, Backbone, Node, Java, Objective C, Linux, HTML5 Mobile Applications, Video production and Visual Design.  Most of our current development is Ruby and JS based, but we determine our technology choices by what a project requires. We pair program and are always on the look out for new members of all levels of experience to join our team.

    <header><h1>Silver Sponsor: BladeRunner.js</h1></header>
    <p>
      BladeRunnerJS (BRJS) is an open source developer toolkit and framework for modular construction of large single-page HTML5 apps. It consists of a set of conventions, supporting tools and micro-libraries that make it easy to develop, test, deploy and maintain large JavaScript apps. BRJS apps are split into discrete modules called Blades, each of which implements a single high level feature that can be developed in isolation.
    </p>
    <p>
      BRJS supports multiple teams simultaneously developing large codebases. It does this by providing powerful workflows based on software engineering principles.
    </p>
    <p>
      With BladeRunnerJS your first line of code is feature code.
