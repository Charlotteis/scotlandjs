        I write about, promote and teach new and open web technologies. Co-founder of Happyworm – a small web agency and makers of the popular jPlayer (http://jPlayer.org) media framework (made in Edinburgh incidentally).

I enjoy pushing the limits of the browser using HTML5 and JavaScript. Though a generalist at heart, I spend much of my time playing with web based media and real-time communications and am actively involved in helping news organisations world-wide as part of the Knight-Mozilla OpenNews initiative, specifically Al Jazeera.

As a lover of all things audio, passion often drives my work and I'm currently enjoying the challenge of taking audio ‘somewhere new’ with my Hyperaudio (http://hyperaud.io) experiments.

        Jason Frame is a Glasgow-based software engineer specialising in exhibition installations and has played key roles delivering internationally recognised projects for names such as Siemens, Bloomberg and his hometown's award-winning Riverside Museum. Jason began coding when he accidentally typed a command that changed the text colour on his Amstrad CPC back in 1988; since then he hasn't improved much but is still doing it anyway. When not programming for money, Jason can be found hacking on introspective tools, toy programming languages and game AI. When not programming at all, he tinkers with power tools and old American V8s.

        I started creating first programs during primary school being inspired by older brothers' IT class home assignments. During years I developed bigger and smaller applications in various programming languages, both as a professional assignments and personal pet projects.

I started my professional career by winning a programming competition organized by vehicle tracking company at the collage. I was a lead developer on some startups that turned out to be a huge success in Poland (ankietka.pl is now number one survey system in Poland). I was also a lead front-end developer who created a 'virtual assessment center' system for one of the biggest Polish telecom companies. Not being satisfied with innovativeness of the tasks, I started applying for fully remote positions at startup companies to work on cutting edge projects which could better utilize my skill set.

My higher level goal is to produce efficient solutions to problems (both engineering and business) that really matter and follow good engineering practices at the same time to provide a solid codebase.

        After my traineeship at InnoGames I continued working there as a lead developer for a big social game. Next station was Digital Pioneers N.V. there I’ve done a lot of high tech protoyping and DevOps working with Symfony2, MongoDB, EC2, Scalarium, Redis, Node.js, CoffeeScript, statsd, metrics and other cool tech stuff. After I left there I joined my current company Jimdo, here I try to bring in my knowledge in software quality and cloud computing.
I really love all the new technologies from NoSQL and node.js to Metrics Driven Development and bringing cool tools and tech to my developer colleagues. And I really really enjoy speaking at conferences, like I did on TakeOff Conference 2013 or FOSDEM 2013.
