      <h3>Bio</h3>
      <p>
        I'm a full stack engineer with love of javascript and all things recursive. My current position is at Fastly, a next generation CDN, where I focus on the configuration front-end, real-time visualizations, and general historical statistics shenanigans.

  </p>
      <h3>Talk</h3>
    <p>
With web applications tracking billions of data-points each day it is no wonder that data visualization is one of the most talked about subjects in the industry. A good solution can deliver valuable insights, but a bad one can waste everyone's time, from engineering to the end users.

</p>
  <p>
In this talk we will explore how we tackled this problem at Fastly. From collection, storage and broadcast on the back end to subscription, querying, and display on the front.    </p>
