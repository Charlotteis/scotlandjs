<p>
  The kind folks over at <a href="http://twitter.com/fuzzyorange" target="_blank">Fuzzy Orange</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/sotr" target="_blank">Scotch on the Rocks</a> are giving away their ScotlandJS ticket!
</p>
<p>
  To be in with a chance of winning the 2 day conference ticket all you have to do is sign up to our NodeCopter event.
</p>
<p>
  On Friday the 26th of May, Fuzzy Orange will randomly select one of the sign ups on the <a href='http://www.justgiving.com/nodecopter-edinburgh' target='_blank'>NodeCopter JustGiving</a> page to gift their ScotlandJS ticket to.
</p>
<p>
  So one lucky person will get to goto NodeCopter, donate money to Maggie's Cancer Centres and get a free ScotlandJS ticket!
