<p>
  Those lovely people at <a href="http://github.com" target="_blank">GitHub</a> have kindly sponsored ScotlandJS for the second year running!
</p>
<p>
  GitHubber, Coby Chapple, is keen to make sure that this is a ScotlandJS that you do not forget and is very kindly hosting Edinburghs first GitHub DrinkUp.
</p>
<p>
  Of course this is open to everyone, not just ScotlandJS delegates, so get yourself to the Royal Dick bar within Summerhall for 7:30pm on Friday the 10th of May!
