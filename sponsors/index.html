    </header>
    <p>
      BladeRunnerJS (BRJS) is an open source developer toolkit and framework for modular construction of large single-page HTML5 apps. It consists of a set of conventions, supporting tools and micro-libraries that make it easy to develop, test, deploy and maintain large JavaScript apps. BRJS apps are split into discrete modules called Blades, each of which implements a single high level feature that can be developed in isolation.
    </p>
    <p>
      BRJS supports multiple teams simultaneously developing large codebases. It does this by providing powerful workflows based on software engineering principles.
    </p>
    <p>
      With BladeRunnerJS your first line of code is feature code.
