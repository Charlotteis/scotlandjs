      On Wednesday the 6th of May join us for an entire day of hacking on the Web Audio API and the Web MIDI API sponsored by <a href='http://thisiscodebase.com' target="_blank">CodeBase</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      We will start the day by giving a short introduction on the Web Audio API, the Web MIDI API, debuggers and other important basics. After that the hacking can begin! Programmers that are more experienced with the API can start hacking right away. You can work on projects in groups or on your own. If you don't know what to hack on we have a list of interesting experiments to get you motivated!
    </p>
    <p>
      After several hours of hacking (approx between 4pm and 5pm) we will present all projects in the evening on the big screen.

      On Saturday the 9th of May join us for an entire day of Code Retreat at <a href='http://fanduel.com' target="_blank">FanDuel</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Code Retreat is all about practising your skills, and learning new ones, as a developer much like a musician practises scales.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day will be broken down into 45 minute sessions. During each of these sessions a different constraint is placed on you to push you out of your comfort zone. How does this impact how you develop code? Come along and find out!
