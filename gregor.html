      <h3>Talk</h3>
    <p>
In the past year something one might call "Backend as a Service" has been popping up all over the place. The promise is: You can focus on building what's unique to your apps, the frontend. The "boring stuff", like user authentication, data storage, payments, you name it - that's already there.
  </p>
  <p>
It empowers frontend developers to build fully distributed, data driven apps without having to set up and maintain a backend.
  </p>
  <p>
Examples are parse.com, backendless.com, simperium.com and a couple of others. They all differ in their approach, but they all go in roughly the same direction. For the past 10 months, we also worked on an open source solution called Hoodie. However, I don't just want to pitch it, but rather want to explain what the overall idea means to frontend developers, and then later in the talk compare the different approaches that are currently available. I'd also love to give a live demo of Hoodie, which is full stack JavaScript btw.

I think this is a game changer. Let me tell you why. And how.  </p>
