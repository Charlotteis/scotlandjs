      <h3>Talk</h3>
    <p>
What if the database was not a black box?

</p>
  <p>
What if the performant hard-core was implemented in C, but a vibrant community could rapidly iterate on the high level features in a dynamic language?
</p>
  <p>

What if you could experiment with all sorts of evented features, a realtime database?
</p>
  <p>

What if that database could be easily installed via npm on any VM, and it ran in the browser?
</p>
  <p>

What if you could have all this and anything else you can build & publish!
</p>
  <p>

You can with leveldb!
