        Introducing Figurepool, an HTML5 diagramming and graphics editor. Figurepool is written from ground-up in JavaScript - front-end (Backbone.js + Raphael), backend (NodeJS + ExpressJS) up to the database (CouchDB). In this talk, I'd like to cover the whole architecture of Figurepool starting with client side implementation of the editor up to the production server configuration with NodeJS, CouchDB, Redis and ElasticSearch.

      <td>
        Have a look at the database ecosystem we have: There are many solutions that work for this or work for that, some more specific like Redis and others a lot more general, like the relational ones, but every db is to be taken as is.

When your application's needs don't fit into one of those schemes, you're screwed. Either combine multiple of them into a big stack that's difficult to manage and you never know if it will work with future requirements. Or just use one and do it the even uglier way.

I don't like either. It's a shame that there is no system or framework for writing databases. For combining your desired replication scheme with exactly the data model you need, where you decide which tradeoffs you make.

But wait: there is! There's a recent development in node.js where several people are paving the way of writing databases in JavaScript.

They often share a strong focus on realtime and distributed computing (as that's what node is good for) and can be combined at will for the databases of the future.

I will walk you through the ecosystem as it is today and show with some live coding how much you can accomplish when combining the right kinds of tools in a simple way.

        Back in December 2011, I was unemployed and took this opportunity to read Mark Miller's thesis and related papers and talks. I discovered the "Virus-Safe Computing Initiative" and the amazing work of people like Marc Stiegler, Alan Karp and Tyler Close.

At first, the work of these crazy computer scientists is a jungle with quotes of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, defeating Skynet, URLs being enough to build a secure web application, security without annoying confirmation popups, etc.
But at some point it all to started to make sense. I learned that well-applied object oriented programing good practices can be all you need to build secure JavaScript and web applications. More than that, I acquired a thought framework helping me to understand whether an application is secure and why. While most developers consider security as a complicated aspect of applications that should be left to experts, "object capabilities" and POLA (Principle Of Least Authority) make it easy to understand the security implications of your code or library code.
In this talk, I'll share with you this thought framework.

        In the past year something one might call "Backend as a Service" has been popping up all over the place. The promise is: You can focus on building what's unique to your apps, the frontend. The "boring stuff", like user authentication, data storage, payments, you name it - that's already there.

It empowers frontend developers to build fully distributed, data driven apps without having to set up and maintain a backend.

Examples are [parse.com](https://parse.com/), [backendless.com](http://backendless.com/), [simperium.com](https://simperium.com/) and a couple of others. They all differ in their approach, but they all go in roughly the same direction. For the past 10 months, we also  worked on an open source solution called [Hoodie](http://hood.ie/). However, I don't just want to pitch it, but rather want to explain what the overall idea means to frontend developers, and then later in the talk compare the different approaches that are currently available. I'd also love to give a live demo of Hoodie, which is full stack JavaScript btw.

I think this is a game changer. Let me tell you why. And how.

        Web apps have proven to be a solid foundation for many tasks that were reserved for 'serious' desktop apps not that long ago. Their complexity grows rapidly making codebase hard to grasp. Errors during implementation are inevitable (at least for us - humans ;) ). As application grows, probability of unwanted effects and regression is becoming a real issue that can ruin project in a long term. Furthermore, development cycle that does not give immediate feedback to development team about effects of changes on the application behavior makes them unaware of the real effects of their code modifications. As if this was not enough, web developers need to live in an ecosystem of diversified browsers on which their app might be used.

Solutions to such problems are available to the public as an open source projects. Selenium has been created to imitate real user behavior as closely as possible. Creating integration tests as a part of development process is really fun as it's basically writing code in your favorite language.

During my talk I will show the optimal development cycle for rich user interface apps, the difference between unit and integration tests, how to start your first cross-browser test with Node, talk about best practices, show both pros and cons, present handful Node tools that will make creating tests even easier, share some tips that will make you tests rock and make a little sneak peak into the future of test automation!

In this talk I will do a live coding demo of a simple app that pulls a feed of images from Flickr and displays them on the screen. I will demo the app in Android, iPhone and Windows 8 emulators. Along the way I'll discuss some of the gotchas that developers need to look out for.

        The resolution of "this" in JavaScript is often a confusing subject for developers. I aim to take the magic out of "this" by describing the different scenarios functions can be called and how it affects the value of "this."

I plan to cover the value of "this" when invoking functions: directly, as a method, with call/apply, and as a constructor. I'll also breifly cover ECMAScript 6 "fat arrow" functions and how that affects the binding of "this." I'll also discuss closures, how/why they're used, and how to properly capture the value of "this" in case it is lost inside a callback function.

We'll also dive into how the JavaScript interpreter creates function objects and how the Execution Context/Activation Object defines scope and "this" at runtime (b/c JavaScript is dynamic)

experience, and then walks through several examples of how encapsulating
different parts of an application into reusable components simplifies
development. It also shows how Enyo, an source object-oriented JavaScript framework, implements those ideas by emphasizing encapsulation and modularity. Enyo contains everything you need to create fast, scalable and cross-platform mobile or web applications. Enyo powers webOS, and was designed from the beginning to work great on mobile devices.

        The Internet these days is all about APIs. Nokia has several APIs, Facebook has APIs, Foursquare, Twitter, Flickr, they all have public APIs. For companies that provide services on the Internet, APIs are a must have. With the data available through APIs, developers build the cool and inspiring stuff that shows up in your Twitter stream every day.

An API is however completely useless when it is not well documented, or when the documentation is not updated with the API itself. Developers need to know in a clear way how to make an API call, and they need to have an exact idea of the response they should expect.
Unfortunately, delivering a product often takes priority over producing good documentation while creating and maintaining documentation that evolves with the API takes time and requires quite some effort and resources. Until now.

This talk is about how my team at HERE went from an obscure bunch of JSON responses to a clean and completely self-documenting API in a matter of hours, by leveraging the power of JavaScript and some of the tools and NodeJS modules that are publicly available with open source licenses.

        There is no doubt that today's web applications continue to grow in adoption, replacing their desktop counterparts in all areas of computation. Essential to their growth is their ability to provide near-native performance and rich user experiences. As these applications grow in essential complexity, they also grow in accidental complexity due to the imperative callback processing style found in most web applications. The asynchronous nature of most of these applications also further compounds the issues due to guarantees around message ordering, and a level of indirection required in callbacks handling events.

Functional reactive programming is one approach for mitigating accidental complexity, using a declarative and composable data-flow model. During this talk, we will look at shafty, an open source ClojureScript project which explores using the functional reactive programming model for building dynamic user interfaces. This talk will provide a basic overview of functional reactive programming, the motivations behind shafty, basic usage of the library and a few example web applications built using the library.

        UI testing has been around for years, but never been part of a hype,
never made it into the daily workflow of most frontend devs, never has been seen as one of these things that makes our lives easier.
Why is this essential tool in our chain treated like a misbehaving stepson?

In this talk we will answer that question,
looking back to when it all started to go wrong,
examine the current state and looking into the future
and how we can bring the power of UI and e2e testing back to the people who build the frontend of the web.

----------------------

Specifically in modern web application development **continous integration** is a generally accepted concept. However, the development cycle of a web application should not stop after a successful jslint run. Continuously **capturing feedback** from the QA team and from real users is what drives a product to **better UX and UI concepts**. Providing the QA team and the users effective tools to express their wishes and to report bugs therefore improves the overall product quality significantly.

Usersnap
--------
In our talk, we will present Usersnap, which is an **in-browser feedback tool**. Usersnap comes with a highlighting tool, a sticky note tool and pen tool which allows to report issues and suggest improvements directly in the users' browser. The annotated screen is subsequently delivered as rendered screenshot to the dev-teams' bug tracking system and includes also important meta information such as the used browser or the screen resolution. Needless to say that Usersnap is not dependent on any third party addon such as Adobe Flash.

        <h2>Description</h2>
      </td>
      <td>
        For many front end developers, including me, a jQuery plugin was their first repository on github. Reading that code again, I found many bugs and I am very grateful that no one ever used it in production. At the time, I was completely confident about my code working as I intended it to, but I never stopped to think twice about why I felt that way. Since then, the most significant tool that I have picked up is unit testing and the biggest hindrance in learning how to unit test has consistently been the event loop. For example, how do I ensure that particular code paths are followed when an element is clicked, double clicked, or if the window has scrolled into a particular state.

Most unit testing examples focus on very straightforward imperative tests. I have seen many explanations of javascript unit testing that describe how to verify the logic behind a calculator or a form validation library, but not how to test a more complex, event triggered interaction.  In this talk, I will address how to begin unit testing jQuery plugins, and how to avoid common pitfalls when dealing with asynchronous, or event handling code. Most importantly, I will explain how to deal with verifying that code is executed when native browser events fire.

I'll walk through two examples of jquery plugins that we will write and unit test during the talk. I will describe techniques that can be used to gain confidence that your plugin acts as designed and explicitly addresses edge cases.  First, we will start off with writing the plugin code and unit testing a simple konami code easter egg plugin that will verify that a desired function will execute once the konami code is typed into a page. Second, we will write the code for a more complicated sticky scroll plugin that will describe how to programatically assert that changes in the state of the page trigger the appropriate responses from our plugin code. After that, I will wrap up with an explanation of how to mock ajax requests and trigger ajax events from your unit tests.

        The list of solidified ES6 features keeps growing and we, on the client side, just get greener with envy. Many of these new features won't be supported in a broad base of browsers for years to come, but there is hope for us nonetheless.  While we don't have the ease of flipping a command line flag, like node, to bask in the warm sunlight of ES6 sugar, I've pieced together a system that gives us the best that we can hope for.

Using a combination of shims and transpilers, we can enjoy these new language features while still maintaining support for all of the browsers you'd need. I'll first explain some of the great new additions to the javascript programming language and example use cases with code that take advantage of ES6's elegance for client side development. I will go through the details of setting up a development environment with source maps for debugging the code that you wrote, rather than what is generated by a transpiler. Then I will discuss setting up a production build system to generate code for non-ES6 browsers.

After listening to this talk, I hope your jealousy will be soothed, and I know that your curiosity will be satisfied.

      <td>
        Douglas Crockford's book "Javascript: The Good Parts," is one of the best selling javascript books of all time and is only 176 pages long.  For most developers, there's an tacit belief that the rest of Javascript falls under "bad," especially when comparing that to the 900 pages of "Javascript: The Definitive Guide"  There are websites dedicated to these list of language mis-features and anti-patterns, and dozens of blog posts about how to avoid the "bad" in your own code.

I don't think that these most of these things are actually "bad". In their day to day, developers don't need to worry about all of these smaller issues. Chances are, a javascript developer has encountered these difficult issues, learned the solution, and then immediately absorbed the concepts.

I'm going to explain to you, the real "bad" parts of the language. These are at least three javascript language features that are the most likely to trip up a javascript developer.  Once you innately understand these three issues, you will become significantly more productive in javascript, and will be a lot less confused when reading through large javascript code bases.

I'll be walking you through at least three concepts within javascript language semantics:
<ol>
  <li>
    What on earth does "this" mean, and in what context does its meaning change?
  </li>
  <li>
    How does prototypal inheritance work?
  </li>
  <li>
    What is hosting? Why do I care what a function expression or function declaration is?

        Node.js seems pretty sweet, sure. It has asynchronous IO, sane stream APIs, and one of the best package managers in open source. Plus, it's javascript.

But when it comes to node.js web frameworks, not all is well in the world. Why is the most commonly-used web framework pretty much the same as Sinatra? Why is the most common way of separating http app functionality based on a hack from WSGI? Why does installing an app pull down half of NPM? Why do we have to not only write routes at *all*, but write them *multiple times*, for server-side views, client-side views, json APIs and command-line interfaces, using a different router for each with arbitrarily different interfaces?

We can do better, and with [the Big framework](http://big.vc/developers) (also [on github](https://github.com/bigcompany/big)), I will show you how.

        November 2010, the W3C announced the deprecation of WebSQL specification, causing web developers around the world to mourn. To those comfortable with relational databases, WebSQL seems to be a natural fit for offline storage.  On the other hand, IndexedDB -- WebSQL's successor -- can appear unruly by only supporting asynchronous API (for now) and missing many commonly used features such as joins, aggregation methods, multiple conditions,...

So what is this IndexedDB? What can it do and how can we truly embrace its abilities?

This talk walks through usage of IndexedDB in common web application scenarios, explaining how to utilize indices and properly structure data for query performance.

        Developers test their JavaScript these days, it's expected. Test frameworks and tooling has drastically improved in recent years, so much so we expect the same level of TDD for our JavaScript as we would from languages like Ruby.

When you have a team of developers working on the same client side codebase you also expect the same practices, continuous build being one of them. I lean toward using Jenkins. The majority of us use node, phantomjs for this kind of task. This will test out JavaScript code using WebKit, a pretty modern environment for JS.

What happens when your code still must operate down to the depths of IE6? It's a horrible situation but one that more people than you think have to deal with. The talk will run through pushing the mundane task of testing cross browser to the Jenkins build using tools such as phantomjs for basic build sanity checks and then using testacualr pulling on services such as BrowserStack for detailed cross platform, cross browser integration.

        Out there on the Internet web developers can find a big universe of jQuery plugins for any need you can think of. Do you need a tooltip? There's a plugin for that. Do you need to handle cookies? There's a plugin for that. Do you want a map in your website? You are in luck, there's jHERE for that!

Why do people create all these plugins? Mostly because they need a reusable component that can be easily be included into their web apps. So they build it, and then they are nice enough to make it available to everybody.

A few months back I created jHERE, with the goal of providing a super simple API for something usually complicated: maps. With jHERE you can create maps, markers, info bubbles, heatmaps and even render KMLs with one line of code.

To make life easier for the users, jHERE is however quite a complex jQuery plugin. First of all it depends on a 3rd-party API (HERE Maps) that is lazy-loaded when the plugin is first instantiated. Additionally it was built to work not only with jQuery, but with other jQuery-compatible APIs as well, e.g. Zepto.js and Tire.js. Finally, jHERE is extensible. In order to save bytes, only a small set of simple functionalities is included in the core. More advanced features can be added by writing extensions.

This talk is about the journey from the first prototype of jHERE to the final, polished version of the plugin. I will start with the basics of writing a jQuery plugin, I will dive into leveraging Promises/Deferreds when 3rd-party libraries are required for the plugin to work, and I will show how to write the minimum amount of code that is essential to guarantee compatibility with other jQuery-like libraries. Then I will go into extensibility and talk about a way to support plugins for a plugin. And finally, how can you make sure a piece of code maintains the right behavior after you make changes and across releases? You can't, unless you write tests for it, so we'll have a look at unit testing for jQuery plugins.

I promise you will see quite some code but also pretty slides.

        Backbone is great for giving us a structure for Javascript front ends. But what happens if you want to gracefully degrade to a plain old request response application if Javascript is unavailable? You end up with two different versions of every view you want to Backboneify. This can become a maintenance nightmare with apps that have more than a couple of views.

In this presentation I'll discuss a simple solution I implemented within a Rails app by using a combination of ERB, CoffeeScript and Treetop. The developer creates a series of rails ERB partials and runs a rake task which generates both the Rails ERB partial and a Backbone template using eco. I'll talk a bit about how I used Treetop to parse ERB as well as my first exposure to Backbone.

Storytelling, clips of films and lots of silly analogies will keep this talk fun and memorable.

        State is hell when working with asynchronous code. Trying to deal with realtime data and user interaction with callback after callback after callback quickly leads to madness. Any callback, called at any time, can modify application state making code complex and hard to reason about.

Functional reactive programming is a powerful concept borrowed from Haskell that makes dealing with asynchonous code much easier (and fun!) to work with. Callbacks are replaced with event streams which can be mapped, merged, filtered and more, without having to manually maintain state! Bacon.js (https://github.com/raimohanska/bacon.js) by Juha Paananen is a lovely little library that implements FRP in JavaScript.

I'll introduce both FRP and Bacon - and with visualisations and examples show just how tasty Bacon is for working with asynchronous code.

        The unit testing web developer population, in general, has been growing by leaps and bounds, but, so far, those gains haven't been as steady on the client side.  I'd like to address a few of the reasons why that is, and how we can change that by unit testing our client side application code as thoroughly as possible.

Most unit testing examples focus on very straightforward imperative tests. I have seen many explanations of javascript unit testing that describe how to verify the logic behind a calculator or a form validation library, but not how to test a more complex, event triggered application.  I'll walk you through a simple unit tested backbone application and explain some design tips for effectively unit testing your code along the way.  After that, I will explain how to effectively mock ajax requests and trigger ajax events from your unit tests.

I will also be giving an introduction to the grunt build tool. I'll show you how to setup grunt in such a way that your test output can be easily integrated with your continuous integration suite as well as run every time you change a file.  Hopefully, eventually, we'll all be able to have the confidence inspired by the green and red lights on a build monitor, on both sides of the great http divide.
