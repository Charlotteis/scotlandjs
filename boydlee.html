      <h3>Talk</h3>
    <p>
Deployd is an open source platform, built on NodeJS and MongoDB, that allows you to create custom JSON API's in minutes, not days. In this brief talk, Boydlee will explain what the Deployd platform is and show you how it really is the simplest way to design, build and manage a REST API. We'll create our collections and API interfaces in real time, extending them with custom JavaScript events and explain how you can further customise your Deployd installation using standard NodeJS modules.</p>
