  <br />This year we are doing something a little different when it comes to talk curation.
  <br />If you buy your ticket before February 25th, you will have the opportunity to rate each of the submissions after CFP closes.
  <br />During this process you will only see the title and description of the submission, otherwise known as a blind vote.
  <br/>
  <br />This means that attendees get to choose which talks are held at ScotlandJS 2013!
  <br />
