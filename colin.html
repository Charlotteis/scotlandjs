      <h3>Talk</h3>
    <p>
Every language has a build tool, Ruby has rake, .NET has PSake, C has Make and now javascript has Grunt.js, an excellent little build tool for all those javascipt jobs that need to be automated.
</p>
<p>

This talk will look at the basics of Grunt.js with setting it up to do things like compress javascript and css, compile coffee script, run test and along with using the power of node to automate other tedious tasks.
