      <h3>Bio</h3>
      <p>
        VP Engineering at Nearform. Love talking about node.js Hardware hacking and websockets
  </p>
      <h3>Talk</h3>
    <p>
There have been some fantastic advances in the node.js and javascript communities over the past year in terms of replication and p2p networks.

  <p>
Unfortunately most of the work is still a little inaccessible and realworld examples that tease out some of the main challenges that could befall a development team are still a little light on the ground.
</p>
  <p>

I am currently working on projects that are meeting these challanges and I would love to discuss some of the work that I have been doing for clients in this space and also talk about some interesting options that developers could bring to their own organisations.
